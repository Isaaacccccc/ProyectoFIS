# Application design 

### Software to be used and design features 

When deciding on a software tool we opted for **Figma**, a UI/UX design app that is intuitive and easy to learn. For this we designed school accounts to be able to access the professional features for free.  

For the realization of the design of the mobile application we prioritized the following: 

- **Minimalist design**: simplifies the user interface, which makes the application easier to understand and use. We seek that the deaf community can understand from the beginning how to use the app, they do not have to struggle or intuit in its use, since we also seek to include those who are illiterate. 

- **Performance**: With the minimalist design we seek that the app is not so "heavy", that any cell phone can use it without any problem. 

- **Versions for IOS and Android**: It is vital that the app can be downloaded from any cell phone, regardless of the operating system, because it is important that every hearing impaired person can access it at any time of emergency.

With this in mind, we decided on the following structure for the user design. 

- **App format**:  A solid grayish black background, changing only in some cases with red and white shades. 

- **Logo**:  In accordance with the app design, the logo will be presented in a black shade with gray undertones. Although a blue and white color palette was initially contemplated, it was decided to modify it to a more austere and simplified composition, in accordance with the minimalist approach that will characterize the design of the application.

- **Introduction with a video**: Introduction through Audiovisual Material. In order to facilitate the successful creation of the account by the user, we have implemented an introductory video in sign language (although it will still be subtitled in Spanish). This will provide the user with a detailed guide of the steps to follow to complete the registration process. The video has been designed to be viewed in both landscape and portrait orientation and will play automatically the first time the user accesses the application. However, the user will have the option to access this again according to their preference, as we have incorporated a feature that allows for later playback. 

- **Log In/Sign Up tab**:  The user will be presented with this tab to make his registration in case he is new (sign up), in which he will be directed to another tab where he will be asked for the essential data needed by the app; in case he has already registered, the user will be directed to the Log In tab, where he will have to put his access data.  

- **Log In tab**: For this tab, the user must have already registered previously, and must enter his/her email address and password; the application will have an option to remember the email address, which will be activated if the user wishes, and then the user will only have to enter his/her password.

- **Registration tab**: In order for the user to register, there will be this first tab in which the user will have to provide his/her e-mail address and a password twice to confirm it.

- **Registration of user data**:  In this tab the user will be able to enter his personal data such as full name, date of birth, blood type, sex, height and weight, he will also be able to enter the data of people close to him so that he can contact them if necessary, the data to be provided are: a photo, full name, relationship and telephone number.  
Similarly, the user will be presented with a tab in which to provide medical data that may be helpful if required, such as: diseases, allergies, chronic condition, operations, lifestyle and current medication, which must be filled in with the corresponding information as appropriate.  

- **Method of contacting the authorities** (button to request support): The application will have an emergency button that the user will slide every time he/she is in a risky situation or observes what is happening around him/her, subsequently, he/she will be able to visualize a menu with the 7 assistance icons mentioned above, and after he/she has chosen the type of emergency, the application will contact the user with the relevant authorities and/or nearby person previously added in the registration data for such situation.  

- **Assistance icons**: In order to make it easier for the user to identify emergency situations, we have implemented the use of seven distinctive icons that will provide you with the ability to communicate with the relevant authorities in each case. These seven icons were selected in consideration of the most frequent classifications of situations that could arise. In turn, each of these classifications has different categories, which are detailed below:

- **Emergency Service Confirmation:**
In order for the user to correctly choose the emergency service they require, a tab has been implemented in which the user will be presented with the type of emergency to request


- **Contact with emergency authorities**:  
In order for the user to see that concrete measures are being taken to provide a quick and effective response to their emergency case and therefore they can feel safer, we have implemented a map where the user will be able to visualize the location of emergency units in real time. Since, in emergency situations, uncertainty can increase people's stress and anxiety, that is why by implementing this functionality we want users to have a better sense of control and greater peace of mind.


- **Cancellation of Emergency Service:**
In certain instances, the user may decide to cancel the previously requested emergency service. Therefore, the application will have an option to cancel it. However, given that it is an emergency service that someone else may need, a penalty will be imposed on the user. This penalty consists of being unable to request the service for 20 minutes, and in the event of three cancellations, the account will be temporarily blocked.
