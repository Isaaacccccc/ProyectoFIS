### Introduction and general description of the application: 

**Background** 

*Haz Magazine* (2017) conducted a census in which it was determined that the majority of people with disabilities used apps to facilitate their daily lives, specifically 73% of people with hearing impairment use them. This for the following reasons: 

- **Communication**: Messaging and video calling apps are critical for communication. They can use text messaging applications, video calls or video interpretation services to communicate effectively with friends, family and colleagues. 

- **Accessibility** in the environment: Apps can help people access real-time information such as maps and directions, enabling them to navigate the environment more effectively. 

- **Assistive** listening apps: Some apps can function as sound amplifiers, helping the hearing impaired to hear their surroundings better. 

As we can see, for this sector of people, the use of cell phones is practically essential for the development of their daily lives and, more than anything else, to meet certain secondary needs.

### Brief description of the purpose of the app 

With this in mind, we started with the realization of the Silhouette app, specially designed to provide assistance to hearing impaired people in emergency situations. This app has been developed with the aim of ensuring the safety and prompt attention of those who face communication barriers due to their hearing condition. 

Silhouette functions as an essential tool that allows users to quickly and effectively access emergency services, providing a communication channel adapted to their needs. Through this application, the hearing impaired can send alerts through a chat with emojis, request help and share critical information in real time.

### Justification of the name  

As mentioned above, the application will be named Silhouette, because the term "silhouette" refers to contours and visual images of profiles, so we can take it as a positive metaphor that serves to represent communication through sign language, which is carried out through gestures and movements of the hands and body; In addition, we consider that the word "Silhouette" is a simple and easy to remember name, which will make it stick in the minds of users and being a simple name, it emphasizes that the application has a simple and intuitive design.  

**Introduction of the team** 

The team is made up of six software engineering students from the Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán. In order to maximize efficiency in the execution of this second phase, the team was divided into two groups: 

- `UI design`:
		- Leonardo Ojeda Vales
		- Moisés Isaac Pech Herrera
		- Jesús Antonio Tec Bonilla
- `Documentation`:
		- Aldrin Enrique Novelo Góngora
		- Karina Gabriela Puch Rodríguez
		- Erick Ricardo Vega Nolasco


It is important to note that, although each half of the team is executing a specific task within the project, they all contribute ideas and supervise both parts in order to maintain fluid communication and guarantee the optimal execution of the project.
