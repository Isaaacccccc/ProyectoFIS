## Project - App *Silhouette*
### Description:
*Improving Communication for Deaf People*

In the digital era in which we live, we have witnessed the significant advantages that mobile tools and applications have brought to our lives. These tools have revolutionized the way we communicate, offering a wide range of methods to express and share our ideas in a convenient and versatile way, adapting to various contexts.

However, despite these advances, it is clear that one group of the population has been neglected in this transition to digital communication: people with disabilities. Despite efforts to support them, there is one critical aspect that has not yet been widely addressed: communication in true emergency situations. 

Our project aims to address this challenge by implementing a rapid communication method that serves as a bridge between emergency services and deaf people. We recognize that many deaf people are not proficient in written language, so we will use images to facilitate communication and enable them to express their needs effectively.

By providing a set of images that represent the emergency in question, our project seeks to empower this community to communicate independently and effectively in emergency situations. Our approach is to ensure that deaf people have access to the tools that hearing people already have.

## Product Evolution

- **Refinement of requirements:** *Again?* Yes, because we needed them to be ready in order to make the interface make sense.

- **Improved UI design:** *New interface?* More like giving a good structure to the interface made in the previous release.

- **Creation of informal tests:** *Is the app ready?* Not really, the UI is ready and that's why we decided to do some testing through forms and maze.

## Requeriments

For the final product, taking into account the changes we made to the requirements in the previous reviews, we noticed that some of the requirements were still complex and infeasible for what we wanted to do, which led us to **eliminate one non-functional and one functional** requirement and **add three new functional** requirements.

## Sprints
For this delivery, 4 sprints were carried out, and a document was prepared in which a summary of the sprints that took place in the 3 deliveries is given.

| [Sprint 9](/Sprints/Sprint_9.md)  | [Sprint 10](Sprints/Sprint_10.md)  | [Sprint 11](Sprints/Sprint_11.md)  |  [Sprint 12](Sprints/Sprint_12.md) |

In addition, an individual contribution table was prepared, in which each activity in the three deliveries was listed. Also a chart with the final participation percentages of each member.

## UI Design

A final interface was made where you can see the ideas raised in the first delivery, so here is a list of the changes made:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Assets/prototype.gif" width="300" height="600">
</p>

- **Improvement of icons**: There were some that did not work within the app and gave other ideas about emergencies.

- **New screens**: Particularly screens where the app settings appear or where you can cancel the emergency.

- **Refinement of the Log In and Sign Up**: In the previous release these did not make sense, that is why now you have to register your email and then enter your data when you start for the first time.

- **Functional emergency button**: This is the main button of the app and we needed users to be able to test it at least informally. Now you can drag it up and it sends you to the emergency tab.

## Informal Testing 

### Google forms

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Assets/forms.png">
</p>

For the informal testing, we implemented a google forms, in which we added the link to the Silhouette App prototype, so that the people could visit it. 
In the forms, we asked them 2 questions about their age and gender, and 10 others on the general operation of the app. Out of these six people, **just one has a relative with these incapacities**.

According to the information, we can agree that both the interface and the design are appropriate, even though we may need to **improve** some aspects, the general idea and functionality of the app is clear and the users find it intuitive and helpful.

To conclude, the results of the Google forms, reflected both a good design and functionality of the app, we will take into account the suggestions given, and the overall results of each question to implement them to make the app better for our users.

### Maze results

Also, as an extra of the tests, a maze project was carried out to confirm the use of the requirements set out in this release. 
There were 5 tasks where the 8 functional requirements were included:
1. **Access the support tutorial**. Requirement #1
2. **Register in the app and enter your data**. Requirements #2 and #5
3. **Access the user settings from the main screen**. Requirement #6
4. **Call for an emergency type** - a person on fire. Requirement #3, #4 and #7
5. **Cancel the emergency**. Requirement #8

The results were that there was a **50% success rate** in the tasks, with 9 people answering the survey. 
On many occasions they failed to complete the tasks correctly, either because of the shape of the app or because they touched the wrong buttons. Something to rescue within the tests is that, it is clearly observed how **all people managed to complete the task of calling emergencies**, proving that the main interface of the app fulfills its purpose.
This shows that there is still a lot that could be worked on within the app.
