## Project - App *Silueta*
### Description:
*Improving Communication for Deaf People*

In the digital era in which we live, we have witnessed the significant advantages that mobile tools and applications have brought to our lives. These tools have revolutionized the way we communicate, offering a wide range of methods to express and share our ideas in a convenient and versatile way, adapting to various contexts.

However, despite these advances, it is clear that one group of the population has been neglected in this transition to digital communication: people with disabilities. Despite efforts to support them, there is one critical aspect that has not yet been widely addressed: communication in true emergency situations. 

Our project aims to address this challenge by implementing a rapid communication method that serves as a bridge between emergency services and deaf people. We recognize that many deaf people are not proficient in written language, so we will use images to facilitate communication and enable them to express their needs effectively.

By providing a set of images that represent the emergency in question, our project seeks to empower this community to communicate independently and effectively in emergency situations. Our approach is to ensure that deaf people have access to the tools that hearing people already have.
