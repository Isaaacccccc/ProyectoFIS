## Project - App *Silueta*
### Description:
*Improving Communication for Deaf People*

In the digital era in which we live, we have witnessed the significant advantages that mobile tools and applications have brought to our lives. These tools have revolutionized the way we communicate, offering a wide range of methods to express and share our ideas in a convenient and versatile way, adapting to various contexts.

However, despite these advances, it is clear that one group of the population has been neglected in this transition to digital communication: people with disabilities. Despite efforts to support them, there is one critical aspect that has not yet been widely addressed: communication in true emergency situations. 

Our project aims to address this challenge by implementing a rapid communication method that serves as a bridge between emergency services and deaf people. We recognize that many deaf people are not proficient in written language, so we will use images to facilitate communication and enable them to express their needs effectively.

By providing a set of images that represent the emergency in question, our project seeks to empower this community to communicate independently and effectively in emergency situations. Our approach is to ensure that deaf people have access to the tools that hearing people already have.

## Kanban Methodology
<img src="https://youssefoufaska.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kanban-in-Action-03.gif"/>

The Kanban method is an agile project management approach that focuses on visualizing and controlling the flow of work. In Kanban, Kanban [boards](https://github.com/users/Isaaacccccc/projects/3) are used to represent tasks or work items, which move through columns representing different states of the process. The main emphasis is on enabling continuous workflow and improving team efficiency.

Unlike other agile methods such as Scrum, Kanban does not define fixed roles such as "Scrum Master" or "Product Owner". Instead, Kanban teams have the flexibility to define their own roles and responsibilities according to their specific needs. This means that roles are not as defined or structured as in other methods, which gives teams the freedom to adapt Kanban to their particular contexts and requirements. We just define the rol of the Leader or the Service Request Manager.

### Process: 
We use the Kanban method for these reasons:

- **Clear visualization**: Kanban provides a clear, real-time visualization of my tasks and projects on a dashboard. This allows me to have an overview of what I have to do and what status my academic activities are in.
- **Flexible prioritization**: I can assign priorities to my tasks and projects as needed and move the Kanban cards on the board according to those priorities. This allows me to adapt to changing academic demands and focus on what is most important at any given time.
- **Stress reduction**: Visualizing and tracking tasks on a Kanban board can reduce stress and feelings of overwhelm, as I can clearly see what I have completed and what remains to be done.
- **Collaboration**: If I am working on group projects, I can share the Kanban board with my teammates for better collaboration and task coordination.
