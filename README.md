## Project - App *Silhouette*
### Description:
*Improving Communication for Deaf People*

In the digital era in which we live, we have witnessed the significant advantages that mobile tools and applications have brought to our lives. These tools have revolutionized the way we communicate, offering a wide range of methods to express and share our ideas in a convenient and versatile way, adapting to various contexts.

However, despite these advances, it is clear that one group of the population has been neglected in this transition to digital communication: people with disabilities. Despite efforts to support them, there is one critical aspect that has not yet been widely addressed: communication in true emergency situations. 

Our project aims to address this challenge by implementing a rapid communication method that serves as a bridge between emergency services and deaf people. We recognize that many deaf people are not proficient in written language, so we will use images to facilitate communication and enable them to express their needs effectively.

By providing a set of images that represent the emergency in question, our project seeks to empower this community to communicate independently and effectively in emergency situations. Our approach is to ensure that deaf people have access to the tools that hearing people already have.

## Product evolution
While we were working on this second installment, we realized that we had to make some changes in order to be able to properly realize the idea we had at the beginning. Here are some of them:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Assets/logoevolution.png">
</p>

- **Design change**:  *Why black and white?* We decided to redifine the branch to make a minimalistic app with colors that represent the concept of the software.
- **Refinement of requirements**: *Were they wrong?* Not really, but they were incomplete or we expected something that is beyond our abilities.
- **User stories**: *New artifacts?* Basically they were there but not explicitly, at the beginning of this second installment we decided to make them in order to divide the interface into sprints that would guide us.
- **Team activities**: *New roles?* Yes, we divided the team in two groups, one for the documentation and another one for the UI design.

	-   `UI design`:
		-   Leonardo Ojeda Vales
		- Moisés Isaac Pech Herrera
		- Jesús Antonio Tec Bonilla
	-   `Documentation`:
		-  Aldrin Enrique Novelo Góngora
		- Karina Gabriela Puch Rodríguez
		-  Erick Ricardo Vega Nolasco

- **UI design**: *What tool did the team use?* Figma, We first made a low-fidelity model to give it a good structure and then followed with a medium-fidelity model.

## Requirements
During this second review, we realized the *complexity* and *unfeasibility* of certain requirements raised in the first stage, which could ultimately cause delays in the process. Therefore, we opted to eliminate or replace those requirements with others that were more viable and fundamental to achieve the purpose of the application. This way, we **retained 5 of the 6 non-functional requirements** previously established, **added 2 new functional requirements** and **modified 3 of the 6 previously established requirements**.

## Sprints
According to the SCRUMban methodology for our project, we divided the delivery into sprints:

| [Sprint 1](/Sprints/sprint1.md)  | [Sprint 2](/Sprints/sprint2.md)  | [Sprint 3](/Sprints/sprint3.md)  |  [Sprint 4](/Sprints/sprint4.md) |
|--|--|--|--|

Likewise, for the Kanban methodology part, the tasks on the board were expanded.

## UI Design (*two models*)
When deciding on a software tool we opted for Figma, a UI/UX design app that is intuitive and easy to learn. For this we designed school accounts to be able to access the professional features for free.

### **Prototypes**:

<p align="center">
  <img src="Assets/low-fidelity model.jpeg">
</p>

First we decided to make a *low-fidelity model* in figma, in which we focused on the basic things that the interface should have. Some points we considered:

- **Minimalist design**: simplifies the user interface, which makes the application easier to understand and use. We want the deaf community to be able to understand from the beginning how to use the app.

- **Performance**: With the minimalist design we seek that the app is not so "heavy", that any cell phone can use it without any problem. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="/Assets/medium-fidelity model.jpeg">
</p>

After making the first model, we made this *medium-fidelity model* because we wanted to show how it will look to the user in a IOS version. We considered:

- **App format**: A solid grayish black background, changing only in some cases with red and white shades.
- **Icons**: We implemented the icons that we will be using for each emergency situation, dividing it into 7 categories (Health Emergency, Car Accident, Fire, Domestic Violence, Crime, Missing Person, Natural Disaster) each one with more icons in order to have a deeper description of the situation.

### Correspondence with requirements
1. ***User Registration/Log In***
The first screen is the registration screen, where the user will be able to enter his or her data to have a record of everyone.
2. ***Support Tutorials***
Son videos que se implementan dentro de la app, las dos ultimas pantallas que salen en las imágenes, tendrá la capacidad de verse hortizontal y verticalmente.
3. ***Access to the location***
This is a permission that appears at the start of the app, where the user can select whether to grant or deny access. It includes a small message about what this data will be used for.
4. ***Registration of personal data***
This screen is where the user is asked for personal and medical data. Within this screen you can edit as many times as you wish and it will be useful for emergency personnel when such a situation occurs.
5. ***Emergency recognition***
The main screens of the app, where the big red button appears. Once selected, several general situations will be displayed and by selecting one of them you will be able to specify the situation in question.
6. ***Protocol/application/API***
It happens after the emergency specification screen, when this message is translated so that the user can be located by the corresponding emergency services.
