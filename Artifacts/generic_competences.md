# Generic competencies
From a compilation of some of the usual competencies in our area of study, we can define the following ideas and how the development of our project proposal could support our training in the following areas.

1. ### _Software development_.
We plan to implement a project that can be implemented in a magnitude that encompasses part of the state, focusing mainly on control tests to implement it in the city of Merida, in the future we will seek to expand the project, but for the moment, the integration of the application wants to maintain a certain quality in which ideas can be seen in a defined way, thanks to the implementation of that mobile application.

2. ### _Software maintenance_.
From the implementation of the software, it will be sought to plan certain ideas that can focus on improving communication for this population. Through the first impelmentacion, we could notice the needs that could arise in the future and factors that could benefit the central population.

Software process management_.
Thanks to the appreciation of the process that is required for a project that focuses on part of the community, as a social project, in which the team members do not really know certain ideas and the context of the non-hearing people, the focus of our ideas has to maintain a control over the needs of the population, in which we must maintain a professional character by not really being part of those who live in that environment.

4. ### _Innovation in software engineering_.
Thanks to a previous investigation that we have made, we were able to highlight some ideas of projects, proposals and similar causes that have tried to improve the communication of this community, although some ideas have been expressed in order to support them, we have not been able to locate projects or ideas that maintain similar ideas to ours. We have rescued some ideas and certain implementations that have made similar projects with other contexts or with a focus on the disabled in order to form the idea, but as such the environment in which we want to venture does not seem exploited.
