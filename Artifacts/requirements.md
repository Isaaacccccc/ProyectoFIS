## This document will explain the main requirements for the *Sign Language* project.


Before starting, the project will be briefly introduced, highlighting the main ideas that we have formulated for the integration of the interface and the main functionalities of the project.

 - Within the main menu different emoticons should be shown so that the user can represent his need at that moment.
 - The application should take into account a method to link to a safe contact of the user, who will be able to help him or be aware of the needs and thus be able to communicate.
 - The application could even include a speech text to communicate ideas.
 
 Below is the list of functional and non-functional requirements for the app.

This is a short list of those features we are interested in and have planned for the moment, more may be added as the file is generated and the project documentation is developed. The present ones, for the moment, reflect an early version of the interface and sketches we have idealized for the application.
