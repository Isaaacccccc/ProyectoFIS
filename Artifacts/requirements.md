## This document will explain the main requirements for the *Sign Language* project.


Before starting, the project will be briefly introduced, highlighting the main ideas that we have formulated for the integration of the interface and the main functionalities of the project.

 - Within the main menu different emoticons should be shown so that the user can represent his need at that moment.
 - The application should take into account a method to link to a safe contact of the user, who will be able to help him or be aware of the needs and thus be able to communicate.
 - The application could even include a speech text to communicate ideas.
 
 Below is the list of functional and non-functional requirements for the app.
 
| Non-functional requirements | Functional requirements |
|--|--|
| Smart devices, this means that the application should be designed so that the user must install it on their device and can be updated through an application store. | The application should integrate some videos that work as tutorials to use the application. |
| Mantainance and updates. The application has to be up to date with different politics and operation systems. | The images shown in the application must play an audio to communnicate what the user is trying to say. |
| Personal safety. The deaf person will be able to contact real emergency services, guaranteeing fast and efficient care for the user. | Emergency recognition. The application will have a system that can understand the emergency that is happening, either by icons in the case of not being able to read or with implemented text otherwise. Also, a multimodal contact system, where you can choose whether you want to make a video call with a LSM interpreter, pre-configured text-to-speech options or a text chat. |
| Usability. The app must have an intuitive and simple interface so that the user can learn how to use it within a short period of time. | It should provide an offline mode so that users can have access to essential content and functions even when they don't have internet. |
| Get legal approval or clearance on the proper way in which to contact emergency services, as there are several laws and recommendations to not bottleneck the emergency lines and make it smoother and better for everyone. As the app will be scaled, our efforts to make it smooth and compatible with emergency service's way of working is key. | A bridging protocol/app/API that will let the application communicate with the phone's cellphone or VOIP call ability. This is essential in order to complete the objective which is to request assistance. In case of difficulty or privacy issues, find another way to notify externally (via other means of communication that aren't in-app) and make it easy for the end-user. |
|The user-aplication interaction will be tailored to the user's needs base on the mode chosen in the register  | The application will have a two-mode login system: one for deaf individuals who cannot read, and another for deaf individuals who can do it |


This is a short list of those features we are interested in and have planned for the moment, more may be added as the file is generated and the project documentation is developed. The present ones, for the moment, reflect an early version of the interface and sketches we have idealized for the application.
