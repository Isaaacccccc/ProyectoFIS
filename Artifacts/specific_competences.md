# Specific competencies 
During this month that we've been working on the design of our project, we could say that some of the specific competencies that we have developed more than we had in the beginning are the following:

| Description of the competencie |How did we use it/improve it |
|--|--|
|1. Explain and apply a systemic software development process appropriate to the scale and complexity of application projects, whether they are new developments or not, taking into account their evolution and change. | Our idea for the project is an application that even though there are some similar, we decided to give it another main focus, which is to help the deaf to communicate easily. |
|2. Describe and apply the necessary tools for the specification, design, verification, and validation of software systems.| GitHub and markdown are both the application and the format in which we are documenting our project, both of them were new for most of us, so we had to learn how to use them for it to work.
|3. Perform in at least one concentration area, work and communicate professionally in interdisciplinary teams. | We learned how to organize the activities that needed to be done in order to optimize the time so we had more chance to review everything to make sure our ideas were correct.
|4. Apply knowledge and skills to improve the software development process. |We are learning how to use software platforms that make us able to both optimize and organize a project and also to familiarise us with software that we'll be using if not for the rest of our lives, for a very long time from now on.
|5.Contribute to the advancement of Software Engineering with a body of knowledge that is both theoretical and practical. | By creating the idea of a new application that could help deaf people, we are helping to innovate the industry in this area and also making sure it works with all of the processes and requirements previously done by the team, taking into account the theory and practice part of all the process of software.
