# New Requirements

### Requirements evolution 

During this second installment, we realized the complexity and unfeasibility of certain requirements raised in the first stage, which could ultimately cause delays in the process. Therefore, we opted to eliminate or replace those requirements with others that were more viable and fundamental to achieve the purpose of the application. Thus, we retained 5 of the 6 non-functional requirements previously established, added 2 new functional requirements and modified 3 of the 6 previously established requirements.
 
 Below is the list of the **new** functional and non-functional requirements for the app.
 
| Non-functional requirements | Functional requirements |
|--|--|
|Smart devices, this means that the application must be designed for the user to install on their device and can be updated through an app store.|Support tutorials. The application must integrate some videos that work as tutorials in LSM to use the application.|
|Maintenance and updates. The application must be updated with different policies and operating systems.|User Registration/Log In. The application must have a registration system in which the user must enter his personal data to be used later when logging in to the application. ***Modified***|
|Personal safety. The deaf person will be able to contact real emergency services, guaranteeing fast and efficient attention to the user.|Emergency recognition. The application will have a system in which the user will be able to choose the emergency that is happening through icons with implemented text. ***Modified***|
|Usability. The application must have an intuitive and simple interface so that the user can learn to use it in a short period of time.|Location access. The application shall have GPS accessibility permissions of the user's phone. ***New***|
|Obtain legal approval or clearance on the proper way to communicate with emergency services, as there are several laws and recommendations to not obstruct emergency lines and make it smoother and better for everyone. As the application will expand, our efforts to make it seamless and compatible with the way the emergency service works are key.|A bridging protocol/application/API that will allow the application to communicate with the cell phone or VOIP calling capability. This is critical to be able to complete the objective which is to request assistance. In case of difficulties or privacy issues, find another way to notify externally (through other means of communication that are not within the application) and provide it to the end user. ***Modified***|
||Registration of personal data. The user will be able to enter his health data, which can be modified by the user; at the same time, the emergency services will be able to access them. ***New***|
