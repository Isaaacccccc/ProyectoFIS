**1.- INDIVIDUALS WITH MODERATE TO PROFOUND HEARING IMPAIRMENTS WHO CANNOT READ IN MEXICO**

Around 2.3 million people in Mexico have a hearing disability, only in Yucatan there are more than 26 thousand people. Among these people, the most affected are those with moderate to profound degrees of hearing loss and those who cannot read, and thus, they are the ones who could primarily benefit.

**2.- EMERGENCY MEDICAL, SAFETY, AND CIVIL PROTECTION SERVICES**

Emergency services are also primary users because the General Law of Civil Protection in Mexico mandates that the government must continually strengthen these services. In this case they would need effective ways to communicate with people with hearing disabilities during emergency situations.

# Secondary Users:

**1.- INDIVIDUALS WITH OTHER DEGREES OF HEARING IMPAIRMENT**

In addition to those with moderate to profound hearing disabilities, there are individuals with other degrees of hearing loss, such as mild or moderate hearing impairment. These individuals can also benefit from services and products designed to improve their quality of life and communication.

# Potential users:

**1.- ELDERLY ADULTS EXPERIENCING HEARING LOSS**

Given that more than 50 percent of people with hearing disabilities in Mexico are over 60 years old, elderly adults who are gradually losing their hearing represent a significant group of potential users.
