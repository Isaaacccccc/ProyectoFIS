# New Requirements (final delivery)

### Requirements evolution 

For the final product, taking into account the changes we made to the requirements in the previous reviews, we noticed that some of the requirements were still complex and infeasible for what we wanted to do, which led us to **eliminate one non-functional and one functional** requirement and **add three new functional requirements**.
 
 Below is the list of the **new** functional and non-functional requirements for the app.
 
| Non-functional requirements | Functional requirements |
|--|--|
|Smart devices, this means that the application must be designed for the user to install on their device and can be updated through an app store.|Support tutorials. The application must integrate some videos that work as tutorials in LSM to use the application.|
| ~~Maintenance and updates. The application must be updated with different policies and operating systems.~~ ***Eliminated***|User Registration/Log In. The application must have a registration system in which the user must enter an e-mail address and password to be used later when logging into the application. ***Modified***|
|Personal safety. The deaf person will be able to contact real emergency services, guaranteeing fast and efficient attention to the user.|Emergency recognition. The application will have a system in which the user will be able to choose the emergency that is happening through icons with implemented text. ***Modified***|
|Usability. The application must have an intuitive and simple interface so that the user can learn to use it in a short period of time.|Location access. The application shall have GPS accessibility permissions of the user's phone. ***New***|
|Obtain legal approval or clearance on the proper way to communicate with emergency services, as there are several laws and recommendations to not obstruct emergency lines and make it smoother and better for everyone. As the application will expand, our efforts to make it seamless and compatible with the way the emergency service works are key.|~~A bridging protocol/application/API that will allow the application to communicate with the cell phone or VOIP calling capability. This is critical to be able to complete the objective which is to request assistance. In case of difficulties or privacy issues, find another way to notify externally (through other means of communication that are not within the application) and provide it to the end user.~~ ***Eliminated***|
||Registration of personal data. The user will be able to enter his health data, which can be modified by the user; at the same time, the emergency services will be able to access them. ***New***|
||User profile. The user will be able to access the application functionalities through the user profile section to modify his personal data, the application permissions and view the tutorial again. ***New***|
||Location of support units. The user will be able to observe in real time the location of the support units together with his own. ***New***|
||Emergency cancellation. The application shall have an option in which the user can cancel the call to the emergency services, although it shall have the sanction of blocking the emergency request for a period of time.***New***|
