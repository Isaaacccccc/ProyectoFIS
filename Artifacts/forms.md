# Google forms

For the informal testing, we implemented a google forms, in which we added the link to the Silhouette App prototype, so that the people could visit it. 
In the forms, we asked them 2 questions about their age and gender, and 10 different ones which included the following topics: 

1. They have some relative with these incapacities
2. If the Log in method is adequate 
3. If the principal personal data is saved between the log in and the user profile
4. Whether there was some problem with the navigation in the app or something was confusing
5. If there was something in which the app did not reach their expectative
6. If they feel like they needed more information
7. In a scale of 1 to five, being 5 excellent and 1 deficient, how would they rate the prototype
8. Whether they think it’d be a good idea to implement in the state 
9. If they find the emergency options adequate
10. Some suggestion they may have for the app 
In the results, 83.4% (5 people) were between 17 to 19 years old, and 16.6% (1 person), 31 years old, which 5 were men and 1 a woman


Out of these six people, **just one has a relative with these incapacities**; they all agreed that the log in method is adequate and think that the data saving is also right, and that the emergency options presented are fine. 
In the structure part, one of them said that it’d **be good to implement security methods for personal data** and another one said that it was intuitive and the flow was pretty clear. 
Moving on to the functionality part, everyone met their expectative with the app prototype, but one said that when it comes to the information we give for its use, we should be more clear in the process of functionality. 
In the scale of 1 to 5, we have the following punctuation: 

1.  0 people
2. 0 people
3. 1 person (*16.7%*)
4. 3 people (*50%*)
5. 2 people (*33.3%*)

 
According to this, we can agree that both the interface and the design are appropriate, even though we may need to improve some aspects, the general idea and functionality of the app is clear and the users find it intuitive and helpful.

Now, as our vision for the app, it’s to help as much people as possible, **50%** of the people who checked our prototype said that it could be implemented in our state and the other **50%** said that it’d be okay but that they don’t know much people with this incapacity. 

For the last question, we asked them to give us a suggestion for the app, most of them agreed that it’s easy to use, and gave us suggestions about the “sanctions” implemented on the app, that in some future, it’d be good to add more emergencies, and for the app functionality, and that we should add an option to video call someone who works in the interface to help the person who need it. 

To conclude, the results of the Google forms, reflected both a good design and functionality of the app, we will take into account the suggestions given, and the overall results of each question to implement them to make the app better for our users.
