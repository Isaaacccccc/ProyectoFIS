# Prioritization
We use the **MosScoW** Method to perform the prioritization.
The MoSCoW method is useful when you need to present business needs to an audience, assess priorities and collaborate on impending deliverables with a group of stakeholders.
We use the 4 levels provided by this method: *Most Have, Should Have, Could Have and Won't Have*.
 
We ranked the requirements in each space and in this table we show some requirements that did not make the final list.
We based the rating on important things that the user should have, things that deaf people would expect from the app when talking about the idea of the app.
