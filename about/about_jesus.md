# About me / Jes√∫s Tec
Hi, usually people know me by my last name "**Tec**", it is kinda silly but I enjoy people calling me that way. I am from Yucatan, Mexico, and I have lived all my life in this state. I think that the excitement of studying this career was born in high school, because I had a subject about web design in which I learned HTML and CSS. I'm not very social but I try to talk to people, even so I always feel anxious to meet new people (sometimes my face turns red).

I've always been a fan of video games and this world of technology, I think it's something born from the books I read about the future when I was a kid. 

## Fun facts :cat:
- I really love cats, I have always felt that they are magical in a certain way because they say that their whiskers are good for when you go on a trip.
- I'm a huge fan o musicals, my favorite musical is Hamilton because of the way all the rhymes are part of each character's story. My favorite character is Angelica.
- My favorite artist is Mac Miller, unfortunately he passed away but all those messages he left in his songs are an inspiration.
- I play the clarinet, my grandfather taught me when I was little and I have been a music enthusiast ever since. Thanks to the music I've get to know places like Guadalajara.
- I used to read a lot, mostly classical books. My favorite one is called "Around the moon" because I like all of this fantasy vibe.
