# ABOUT ME : ERICK VEGA
My name is Erick, I am 19 years old, and at the moment, I am studying software engineering at the Faculty of Mathematics at UADY.
I'm here because of my passion for technology, mathematics, and my love for learning new things. I'm just starting with all this knowledge of software engineering, so I'm very excited.

**Fun facts:**
* I love listening to music, mainly from my favorite bands, some of the are Twenty One Pilots, The Strokes, and Imagine Dragons.
* I enjoy strategy games like chess, although I also like sports like soccer. 
* I like anime
*  I would like to learn to play musical instruments; I'm trying to learn to play the guitar, but I suppose I still have a long way to go.
