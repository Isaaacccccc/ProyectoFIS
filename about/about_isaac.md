This little, silly and funny kitty is my friend Siamimi, I love her very much and I appreciate her too much, she is 3 years old and she is a cute Siamese. I'm Isaac, I really enjoy spending time relaxing in my studies, I listen to different reviews about movies, video games or music and I love coffee, I usually go out to a coffee shop at different times during the week. 

## Career wise
I have known my focus of interest towards information technology, programming and service development for as long as I have known, it has always been a part of my daily life that I have enjoyed appreciating. As a child, I managed to have different video game consoles and a computer that I loved to try to spend my free time, as I grew up I developed a taste for computers and the way in which its components were integrated to allow the work of different processes, as well as achieving the projection of different calculations in a small device. Over time, I was able to get closer to a career environment in which I felt very comfortable, because my brother allowed me and showed me different aspects of his day to day life as a systems engineer. I have had some jobs thanks to him related to development and currently I would like to focus my knowledge on databases, the implementation of artificial intelligences and their integration into everyday life.

### Other extra information

 - I enjoy going out with my friends, this allows me to have a pretty open personality, I like to proclaim that I am someone social and nice, but that also means that sometimes I can be really careless with my chores or my obligations.
- I love cats, they are my favorite animals as well as ferrets.
- I enjoy customizing mechanical keyboards, currently I don't have any because I recently sold the first one I had, but in the future I would like to have a collection of keyboards.
- I like calm music, Natalia Lafourcade is one of my favorite artists at the moment; I'm also a fan of rock, Arctic Monkeys and The Strokes are some of my favorite bands; although I also enjoy other artists and bands like Bj√∂rk, Enjambre, Faye Webster, Rosalia, Her's or New Jeans.
- My current favorite movie is Aftersun and I'm a fan of Better Call Saul and Adventure Time.
