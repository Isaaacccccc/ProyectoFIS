# About me
Hi, my name is Karina Gabriela Puch Rodr√≠guez, but everyone calls me Gaby, I'm 19 years old and I'm studying Software Engineering at the Faculty of Mathematics, UADY. 
I'm new at software development but I find all of this very interesting and I'm looking forward to progress in my software skills, I'm currently taking a Python course for beginners and I'm hoping to be upgrading my knowledge not only in this program language, but also in different ones that I'll be using in some time. 
Some of my qualities are that I'm responsible, organized, and creative and I always look for the bright side of everything. 

## Extra Facts
- My favorite artists are Taylor Swift and Harry Styles. 
- I really love listening to music, it makes me feel calm and it's relaxing for me to sing and follow the melody, I let myself be led by the music. 
- I love cats, all of them have different personalities and I find that really cute. 
- Around two years ago I read a book on the Greek mythology topic and even though I don't know much about it, I have also read two or three more books related to it and I find it really interesting.
- I love watching romcoms and sitcoms.
- I like to read about different genres, but lately, I've been more interested in mystery and romance (sometimes heartbreaking) books
- I'm an iced coffee girl, I just love it.   
- I like to cook and bake, but most of the times it doesn't end well.
