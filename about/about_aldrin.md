## About me / Aldrin Novelo
Hello, my name's Aldrin Novelo. I'm 19 years old. I like cats, and right now, I'm studying software engineering at UADY. I'm really interested in the software development process (not just programming) because it's much different than I thought. Also, I have taken C++ and HTML, CSS courses before so I have basic notions programming and I really enjoy coding web pages.

### Fun facts 
- Some people call me "Enrique" or "Quique", I don't like it so call me Aldrin or don't call me. 
- I enjoy exercising. I usually go running in the evenings or work out at home.
- I like cats, but interestingly, I don't have a single one because my family don't like them.
- I'm fascinated by anything related to the paranormal.
- I enjoy listening to the music of Twenty One Pilots and Imagine Dragons in my free time.
- I like learn new things and practice them.
