### Justification
The estimation was made thanks to the information provided by [DATA MEXICO](https://www.economia.gob.mx/datamexico/es/profile/occupation/desarrolladores-y-analistas-de-software-y-multimedia?employSelector5=salaryOption&growthInformal=informalValueOption), a census that recapitulates information about different jobs, labor informality, as well as the work environment, visualization of different jobs focused on the area in job search pages (Indeed), as well as comments rescued during the Software Engineering Fundamentals classes and own knowledge of the RemoteTask company.

The resulting estimate was appreciated between $8, 000 and $15, 000 MXN considering that it is a school work, we will consider values between $5, 000 and $10, 000 monthly, since, we were developing most of the knowledge that we carry before the end of the semester, denoting the region and the state in which we are, as well as the level of English maintained by the team members.

Regarding the effort, since the learning of different concepts was achieved on the fly, as well as the certification of some courses for some members or the job opportunity for some, it can be considered that, in large aspects, there were certain tasks that were quite complex for some members, highlighted in the following paragraph, with respect to the sprint that was selected. In terms of time, a period of approximately 3-4 months was maintained. From August 29, 2023 to December 10, 2023.

### Cost-dependent calculation


During the sprint, 7 tasks were performed.

Sprint cost = 0.25 (approximately one week) * $70, 000 MXN = $17, 500 MXN

Cost per sprint function point = $17,500 / 7 (FP) = $2,500

Sprint duration = 7 (sprint points) / 19 (total monthly points) = 0.3648 months = 11 days
