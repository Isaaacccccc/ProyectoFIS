|During this week the team was dedicated to the correction of the non-functional/functional requirements and the progress of the prototypes. The weekly meeting was held.| The team **had doubts with the functional requirements** that we had to change because we realized that some of them were too complex to implement. However, after talking it over we were able to come to an agreement.|**Correct the user stories** based on the new requirements, start with the presentation and finish with the documentation.|
