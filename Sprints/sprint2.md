| We met in a virtual conference to talk about the week's progress, what we could improve from those activities (in this case about the user story prototypes) and the activities to be done for the next week. In addition, we discuss how to improve/correct the requirements.| The team had problems because we still had doubts about *how the application should work* and therefore how the design should be, however, when we presented the progress to the professor we noticed that we were on the right track.|**Modify** functional and non-functional requirements |
