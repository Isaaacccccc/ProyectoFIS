## Course critique
### Aldrin Novelo

From my point of view, I really liked this course because it helped me understand many ideas about what software engineering truly is. One thing I want to highlight is the process of making a software product. Before I started my studies,
I thought software engineering was mostly about coding, but I learned that coding is just a small part. I learned about other important steps in development, like work models and software life cycles, the things a program needs to do, unit testing, quality and 
management models, and also how to estimate software projects correctly. It was cool to find out that coding is only a small part of all the things involved in software development, and there are more important ideas and steps.

I don't really have any problems with the course, but if I had to suggest something to make it better, I would have liked more hands-on activities with the things we were learning. Not just answering questions about the topics using our own project, because I find it easier to learn when I can practice the concepts. But actually, I think it was a good course.
