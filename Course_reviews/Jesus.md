# Course critique

During the FIS course I learned many things that I had not heard of before, the truth is that I did not know what they were talking about when they mentioned SCRUM and it was scary not knowing those concepts and that my classmates did know. All in all, I think I really enjoyed the activities that the teachers planned for us. They gave us an idea of what it would be like to be inside a real software engineering project.

About the activities I consider that they were very well executed, although I think that there should be more ways to check that the knowledge was acquired, I say this because the form of the PD was not very much to my liking. I think that the sessions should be more dynamic, I really prefer that teachers give us real data and make us question ourselves about concepts within the area, instead of long sessions where we see concepts and situations where I do not find a meaning.

I would mainly propose as an activity to be able to copy an app at some point because I think it is a good way to learn, copying the ideas that others did; I also think it would be something that could be added in the portfolio for the working world.
