# Course critique
## Erick Vega

The course was very important to me, as it served as a guide from the beginning to truly understand what it means to be a software engineer and as an introduction to the topics we will address in the future.
Throughout all the activities, I realized the importance of having effective organization with my team, as well as following a clear methodology.

One aspect that stood out during the course was the significance of each process, especially the requirements phase, where real-life cases were presented to illustrate why things could go wrong. 
Additionally, there was a crucial emphasis, particularly on the estimation process, where an error can result in a loss of financial resources.

Overall, it was a new experience where I learned from both successes and mistakes with my team. As a suggestion, I would like to see more information and examples related to the use of tools like GitHub. 
While I understand that students have the responsibility to seek for knowledge, as the  first semester, I felt the introduction was somewhat fast, and at times, I felt lost. 
I also recommend a more dynamic approach in classes, incorporating real life examples or workplace scenarios. Initially, I had the feeling that too many concepts were being explained, making it challenging to follow at times.
