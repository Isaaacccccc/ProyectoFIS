# Critique of the course
## Isaac Pech Herrera
Personally, I loved the course too much, I feel that more than a class focused on a subject like the common core or something focused on the application of certain tasks, this course focused mainly on talks to introduce us in depth to the work environment of the Software Engineer. My idea when entering was quite focused on how the programming process would be given, understanding that much of the career would focus mainly on it, which, after so many ideas that I have understood these last months, I feel that it is correct and at the same time, it is not.
My older brother, is 23 years old and has a degree in Systems Engineering from the UPY (Polytechnic University of Yucatan), so as far as possible, I was interested in different concepts and applications that he made in his work, since, in his case, for some years, within the career, he had the opportunity to seek employment, which to this day maintains, as far as I know, has also taken advantage of the opportunities that the company has given him. Taking my brother as a reference, I could better appreciate the context of the career, although in reality they are different engineering, in his case, being Task Manager, much of the consideration of the scores, the workflow, as well as the knowledge about the salaries and the experience that can be acquired, were quite adaptable to me.
Going back to the personal side, I had the opportunity to work with him for a few months, really without being inside the company, but that helped me to become more familiar with the concepts, such as daily sprints, calls, workflow, part of the coding, among other things that I could see and I liked. Going back to the beginning, I really enjoyed the course, I would have liked to be able to adapt my time to be more focused on the race, but I feel that most of the ideas are with me, so the aspect of the course that in the end results in my learning more than in the lessons I could hear, I think it managed to rescue several main aspects. I would suggest incorporating more hands-on activities like the one we had at the beginning of the course for designing an algorithm to get from point A to point B, but other than that, I don't have any more comments, bringing in guests is very nice.
