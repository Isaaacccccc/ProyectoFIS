# Course Review

Overall, my experience in the Fundamentals of Software Engineering course was enriching and positive. I concur with my peers regarding the appreciation for guest sessions, which provided a realistic and practical perspective on the daily activities of a software engineer. These instances were crucial in demystifying preconceptions and offering a more holistic view of the field.

The project developed throughout the semester, with its emphasis on using GitHub and creating a software product, constituted a valuable learning experience. Although we initially faced challenges in using GitHub, overcoming these obstacles strengthened our technical and collaborative skills. Observing how different parts of the project came together to form a functional product provided a concrete understanding of the practical application of the theory learned in class.

Similar to Isaac's experience, I initially expected a more programming-focused approach. However, the breadth of the course allowed me to appreciate the diversity of aspects involved in software engineering. The introduction to work-related elements, such as scores, workflow, and salary considerations, contributed to a more comprehensive view of the profession.

Regarding potential improvements, I agree with the suggestion to incorporate more practical activities, following the model of the initial algorithm design activity. Although there are always areas for refinement, the course provided a solid foundation for understanding both the technical and work-related aspects of software engineering. The combination of theory and practice, coupled with valuable guest sessions, contributed to a comprehensive and enriching educational experience.
