 This section of the project recapitulates the logbook of tasks performed during the development of the product, considering the 4 months of the project. Starting from the determination of the project on August 29, 2023 until its completion and delivery on December 10, 2023.
 
### Week 1 (August 29 - September 4) 
Creation of the team and search for members.
During this week we simply organized the team, defined some of the roles and talked a bit about the expectations of the project.
### Week 2 (September 5 - September 11)
Project proposal week.
We planned a series of ideas along with brief descriptions to generate some brief observations for each one of them and highlight the project that could best fit our ideas, one that contains characteristics that the team would like.
### Week 3 (September 12 - September 18)
Product Description.
Having obtained the main ideas that could stand out above the others, three were chosen, an application that works as a Q&A bot, the implementation of a social networking website for school reviews and networking among students, and finally, an application that can support the deaf and illiterate in situations of danger or emergency service requirement. Resulting in the latter as the main one, the Github repository was generated where we started to implement brief features from each of the team members.
### Week 4 (September 19 - September 25)
Characteristic elements for the first observation of the project.
The teachers presented a checklist in which they highlighted what was necessary for the first review of the project, highlighting the integration of the project proposal, the listing of the requirements, the description of the users and the relationship with the competencies. In addition, some courses on GitHub were retaken, since the first repository that was created, had too many problems of organization and management with the application, being able to understand it in a better way, it was possible to generate a more appropriate and simple one.
### Week 5 (September 26th - October 2nd) // Delivery of the first delivery
Conclusion of the video presentation and completion of the first video observation.
In this week, we focused on polishing certain features of what was requested in the first deliverable, in order to move them towards the video presentation. 
### Week 6 (October 3 - October 9) 
Planning of objectives within the margin of the second delivery, correction of the requirements and the approach of the following activities, as well as their role derivation. 
Within the library, a group meeting was held in which we began to define the ideas for the second delivery, mentioning the generation of the interface and its own documentation to describe what was done during the weeks, from this, we characterized who would perform each task depending on the complexity of the task, in this case, In this case, it was planned that the team would be divided in two, one team managing the implementation of prototypes and interfaces, while the other focused on the idealization to refine aspects of the project, its description, the activities performed and the completion of a user manual, we began to consider the correction of the requirements to better focus them to the context.
### Week 7 (October 10 - October 16)
Design of the prototypes with interface highlighting, a small log in menu and 0register to be able to contemplate the needs of the users, as well as the definition of the objectives to be added.
During this week, the members in charge of the generation of prototypes using Figma described an implementation to plan the stylized nature of the application, a small section for the registration of users and the generation of basic sketches to see how the main function should look like to request help from the support services.
### Week 8 (October 17 - October 23)
Refinement of different elements of the documentation generated in the first delivery, appreciation of the interface and observation of the user stories.
The previous documentation was reviewed in order to select changes to be generated regarding the logo design, the distinction of the application designs, as well as the testing or appreciation of objectives through the use of user stories, in addition, we sought to continue with some particularities of the interface, in order to add animations and functions for the demonstration of operation.
### Week 9 (October 24 - October 30) 
Adaptation of the progress within the context of the second delivery.
During this week, we sought to conclude the delivery of the first prototype with the functionalities for the animation of each of the activities, in order to begin to pass the information in an organized way to the repository in GitHub, the Branch was generated and we sought to conclude the relationship between each of the documents. Reviewing again the score assigned for each of the tasks.
### Week 10 (October 31 - November 6) // Second deliverable
Continuation of the user interface and post-second delivery crisis.
This week we had a problem delivering the file, as one of our colleagues, who was in charge of the editing, had a problem with his connection. He had a problem with his connection, so he was not able to send us the complete file before it could be delivered on time, which despite annoying us a little, we understood that it was actually out of his hands, so we requested that next time he be somewhat empathetic with us to support us by locating a method of contact.
After that, we focused on the documentation of the application, since the wireframe was raised, we wanted to re-interpret the original interface that we presented previously, highlighting the errors that existed in the format.
### Week 11 (November 7 - November 13)
Sketching ideas about the video, as well as introducing new tasks.
At this point, we really understood that there were several positive aspects done on time, so we started brainstorming to present the requirements of the video, at this point we did not have the criteria it will require, but we began to distinguish ideas that we wanted to take up, proposed from the sketch of the ideas in general, so we took into consideration in reviewing fundamental aspects of the repository, to correct them to our current vision, taking into account the knowledge we had acquired up to this point.
### Week 12 (November 14 - November 20)
Release of the necessary criteria for the third delivery, understanding of some talks to apply in the project.
At this point, we focused on the application of the talks, to recapitulate aspects in which we could improve, in addition we were presented with the details of the third delivery, so we were in charge of dividing and segmenting the main tasks, rescuing the important points to develop the contribution metrics. In addition to, appreciate the changes we should make in the repository and the new structure that we must integrate.
### Week 13 (November 21 - November 27)
Bug fixes based on the review presented by the tutor, progress on the criteria presented by the third deliverable.
We received feedback from previous deliveries, so we started with the corrections and held a meeting to verify changes, advantages and disadvantages we have as a team. In general, we did well in each of the assessments, although, we had a problem that we did not count on because we directly ignored it or, better said, we did not notice a required point in the second delivery, it was curious, but it also gave us the opportunity to plan how to solve it in the delivery. We continued with the elaboration of the ideas needed for the recording of the product, and we adapted another method of valuation of the contributions, based on a talk we received on November 23, which supported us with the ideas we had rescued in the past weeks. At this point the interface is almost ready, we only verified to incorporate the functionality of each one of the buttons, as well as the adequacy of the missing requirements.
### Week 14 (November 28 - December 4)
Implementation of the unit tests, as well as sketching and recording of the video for the third delivery.
During this week, we appreciated the finalization of the application design and functionalities, adapting the requirements and validating the verification of them to later perform a survey to appreciate if the application is functional, so we implemented the tests and verified the results to appreciate if changes should be made to the application. In this case, we did not manage to consider disabled people to test the application, so we used hypothetical cases in users to appreciate it, during this week more tasks were incorporated for the criteria of the third delivery. On the other hand, we made the script of the video and upon agreement, we started with the recordings.
### Week 15 (December 4 - December 10) // Third deliverable
Finalization of the project, appreciating the last additions of the project, editing the video and last verification of the repository to present the last delivery. Last week of the project, we started to elaborate the last adjustments of the project, adding the information requested by the teacher, also, thanks to the recordings we made previously, we simply denoted the addition of these additions, we tried not to repeat the problem that arose in the second delivery, finalizing the editing of the video with time to resort to certain changes, finally, we added the parts of the project in the repository and validated all the information, ending the project with the conclusion and reflection of our knowledge rescued in the course.
