# Individual contribution metrics
## First and second delivery
When initializing the project, we highlighted different meetings for the definition of the contribution metrics, presenting the first idea based on the distinction of the workload that we consider for each of the tasks, distinguishing between Low, Mid or High, although without adapting any score for each of them in a coherent or established way with a precise justification.
From the second delivery we decided to place these ideas in a better way, based on:
- Low task = 1 point
- Mid task = 2 points
- High task = 3 or 4 points

As can be seen, a minimal distinction was made between low and medium tasks, while in the case of high-level tasks we kept the selection of 3 to 4 points to denote the level of load they represent. This method we felt worked better for us, but at the same time presented us with the guideline that there were some somewhat unfair tasks for the members, so we were able to make a better balance of the tasks to avoid it happening again.
However, in the third period of the semester, a guest of the class presented a class in detail where he rescued this point to explain it to us again and gave us some tips to make the calculation. So we were able to improve the previous proposal we had developed.

Here is the resulting idea with the definition of tasks from the beginning of the course and how it progressed during these months:

As can be seen in the examples, during the early stages of the project we applied a methodology based on the rating by weight of the product with an approximate margin of 5-25 points, in fact we did not have much idea of how to reflect this rating:

## Third delivery
In this case, the distribution was made in a more objective manner to manage the values that could support the justification for the previous stage, seeking to better adapt the scores. The graph shows the total sum of points, in which the re-statement of the first delivery was considered and those of the second delivery were added.
Next, the final table will be presented with the introduction of Sizing based on scores, priority and t-shirt measurements:

Regarding the numbers, each of them correspond to a team member in alphabetical order.
