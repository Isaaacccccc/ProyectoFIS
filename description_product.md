## target
Behind the production of Silueta, it is planned to focus mainly on a communication proposal for those people who need it to be independent and more accessible to themselves. Within the state, it will be implemented to support the daily life of those people, providing a tool that can better show off those ideas, thoughts, needs or emergency situations that require in an instance of their day. In addition, in this way it will be possible to support the inclusion process that has been tried to implement, since thanks to this service it is planned to break those barriers that exist between the hearing and non-hearing population, trying to highlight those tools for the community to adopt more pleasant practices among its members.

### scopes

 1. it is planned to make certain implementations to clarify the customization of the application for each user, where ideas can be presented in which in a certain way, there is a relationship between a non-hearing person and a hearing person, to designate him/her as a manager or someone who can be there to support him/her in large parts of the day, in addition to a configuration and creation of certain images for each user to designate which one could be more useful to him/her.
 2. as we want to be an application capable of functioning as a tool designed to be useful on a daily basis, we plan to consider its integration by promoting its ability to adapt to different contexts, whether social, academic or work.
 3. at the same time, it is proposed as a project in which a better interpretation can be made thanks to the participation of the community, in which it will seek to promote inclusion and improve communication with the aim of highlighting the relationships that can exist between society through altruistic support.


### limitations

 1. unfortunately, for the implementation of the project it is required that the interested users have internet connection and smart devices, which due to their context, there is a great possibility that they do not have easy access to cell phones, which limits the benefit of the project.
 2. as a result of some research we can notice how sign language, despite being in a certain way, defined with a standard that is denoted as Mexican Sign Language, actually bases part of its establishments and rules in the region in which it is provided, so the selection of the content to be implemented, should be broad to avoid ambiguity.
 3. it has been planned to implement besides the selection of images, a proposal of words that can describe those images. although, unfortunately, illiteracy in this community of people is frequent and there are high indications that could reduce the implementation of this idea, from it, arises the thought of illiteracy about the visual aspects of the environment that surrounds us, since despite being able to understand much of the meaning of those ideas, they may not fully understand certain things.
