## Value Proposition 
The mobile application stands out for bringing together the best features in the market in one place, in addition to having an essential feature that sets it apart from other current applications. It offers two service modes, one for deaf individuals who cannot read and another for those who can. This functionality is highly valuable because it has been observed that current market apps are not inclusive and exclusively target individuals with hearing disabilities who can read, leaving out the individuals who can't. For this reason, we consider it important to provide support both sectors through inclusive features such as interaction through images, assistance through images that produce key sounds, contact with local emergency and security numbers, and tutorials to support users to understand how the applicationÂ works.
